The Idea:
To provide the farmers with a technology which will help him in his work by using various technologies with some complex computing around them. JaiKishan is a mobile application which uses AI, Android , ML,data analysis , data visualization and a lot more to help farmers. The main idea being that this application will provide farmer a detailed weather forecast , so that he can make his arrangements. It will inform him of any weather catastrophes which may occur by sending him a message alert to his mobile, it will inform him of the latest prices for the crop in the market , A suggestion for what crop is best to farm under the conditions which are upon him is also provided , Predicting a pest when itâ€™s image is input by the farmer and also giving the most optimum pesticide for the found pest is also done , an alert system for farmer is also a feature in this application. All the processes run on a server in the backend , the farmer only needs to install the android application and needs to have a reliable internet connectivity so that he can communicate with the server.
